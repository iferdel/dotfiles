ft stands for 'filetype'. In neovim, filetype is almos equivalent to 'language'
The files in here are all .lua, but their names specify their filetype (alias, 'language')
The idea is that these files would be considered only for the language it belongs to as an 'additional' set of configurations, keymaps, whatever.
